# Manual QA Practice ‚Äì SiteGenesis E-commerce Platform

This project includes manual test cases and bug reports I created while practicing QA testing on the SiteGenesis demo e-commerce website.

I focused mainly on the login and checkout modules, and also explored the rest of the site using exploratory testing.

---

## What I Did

- ‚úÖ Created test cases for login and checkout modules (positive, negative, edge cases)
- ‚úÖ Reported bugs with detailed steps and video proof
- ‚úÖ Used exploratory testing across other areas (search, cart, navigation)
- ‚úÖ Documented all results in structured Excel files
- ‚úÖ Linked bug reports to relevant test cases for traceability

## Why I Did This

I worked on this project before earning my ISTQB CTFL certification, as part of my self-learning and transition into QA.

My goal was to understand real QA workflows and apply theory through hands-on testing in a real environment ‚Äî not just from books or videos.

The platform I tested:

## üìÅ QA Documentation by Module

All test cases and bug reports are organized by feature in separate Excel files. Each file includes two sheets: `TestCases` and `Bugs`.  
Bugs contain direct links to recorded testing sessions hosted on **ScreenPal**.

| Module        | Path                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Login         | `QA_Documentation/Login-Module/LoginModule_TestCases_and_Bugs.xlsx` |
| Checkout      | `QA_Documentation/Checkout-Module/CheckoutModule_TestCases_and_Bugs.xlsx` |
| Other Areas   | `QA_Documentation/OtherBugs/OtherBugs_Exploratory_Testing.xlsx`     |
